      <pre style="font-size:20px;text-align:center">
         There was boy whose life was tormented.
          Forced by his parents to bend to their will,
        He envisioned a dream out of desperation.
        A dream that will open a door to be free from torment.
      </pre>
        <pre style="font-size:20px;text-align:center">
           Although years have passed from that day,
          He remembers that day as it was like at the back of his head.
          He may hate his parents,
          Deep down his love and care for them would forever remain.
