            <pre style="font-size:20px;text-align:center">
         There was boy whose life was tormented.
          Forced by his parents to bend to their will,
        He envisioned a dream out of desperation.
        A dream that will open a door to be free from torment.

        <pre style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;">
           Although years have passed from that day,
          He remembers that day as it was like at the back of his head.
          He may hate his parents,
          <ins>Deep down his love and care for them would forever remain.</ins>
